"""
Self-healing system refers to a system that can detect issues (like a glitch or fault) and automatically correct or re-establish its secure state. In cryptographic systems, this means regenerating random masks or shares after each computation, so that even if a fault (glitch) occurs, it doesn’t compromise the integrity of the data.

1. 
Dynamic Masking:
At every step of the computation (e.g., every masked AND, OR, etc.), you re-randomize the mask or shares.

Even if an attacker injects a fault or tries to probe intermediate values, the attacker gets different values each time, preventing them from predicting or inferring the secret.

2. Error Detection:
You can verify if the result matches the expected value after each computation step.

If there's a mismatch or an unexpected value, reset the system or flag it as compromised.

3. Self-Healing Mechanism:

After detecting a fault or corruption, the system can reinitialize the shares or random values and continue from a known safe state.

"""
"""
1. Randomize Shares After Each Computation
After every computation (masked AND, OR, etc.), re-split the result into new shares.
This prevents any attacker from using past information to predict future results.
"""

    # Generate new random shares each time
    new_share0 = random.randint(0, 1)
    new_share1 = value ^ new_share0
    return new_share0, new_share1

"""
2. Use Redundancy Checks (e.g., parity checks or checksums)
Before completing any operation, verify if the shares are still consistent.
If the system detects a mismatch or inconsistency, reset shares and restart the process.

        return False
    return True

"""
3. Error Detection During the Computation
After performing a cryptographic operation, verify if the result is correct and matches the expected outcome. If not, halt the operation and reset the system.

4. Re-randomize Mask After Each Operation
After every computation (e.g., after an AND or OR), you can regenerate fresh random values for future operations.
This ensures that even if an attacker has seen one result, they cannot use it to predict future computations.

5. Backup Safe State After Each Round
Store a secure checkpoint after each round of computation so that if anything goes wrong, the system can recover to a known good state.
This might include storing checksums or consistency signatures.

"""
Fresh randomness at every step ensures that even if the attacker watches the process, they cannot track any secret over time.

Consistency checks ensure that if an attack modifies shares, the system detects it.

Self-healing through re-randomization and state backups means if an attack is detected, the system can recover to a safe state and continue its operations securely.

Self-healing ensures that even if an attacker glitches or interferes with the system, the cryptographic process remains unbroken.

Randomization and error detection are key to making the system resilient and secure against faults.
