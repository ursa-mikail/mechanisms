# Tacit Implicit Agreement Using Garbled Circuit
1. Define a logic function like a & b.

2. Each of the two inputs (x, y) can be either 0 or 1.

3. The output of that logic function is evaluated for all possible combinations of (a, b), encrypted using keys associated with the input values.

4. These encrypted outputs are then exchanged.

5. Only if the correct combination of keys (keyX and keyY) is available, can the correct output be decrypted.

This can be interpreted as a 1-bit secure function evaluation.

## ðŸ§  How This Can Be Used in AI Privacy
ðŸ”¹ 1. Secure Feature Evaluation
AI models often rely on private user features. Using logic gates and encryption:
- You can securely evaluate decision tree nodes (feature_i > threshold, etc.) without exposing feature values.
- Each party (client and server) only learns what theyâ€™re supposed to â€” not the full inputs or model internals.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Homomorphic Token Logic
This encryption can simulate homomorphic behavior:
- For example, token authorization decisions (user_in_group & request_is_valid) can be encrypted so only valid tokens yield results.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Encrypted Model Execution
Using Boolean gates and logic combinations:
- You can execute portions of an ML model (e.g. neural nets converted to logic) entirely in encrypted space.
- No raw input data is exposed to the model provider.

## ðŸ§­ Enhancements
1. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):
Replace symmetric key encryption with FHE to allow evaluation directly on ciphertexts.

2. Multi-Party Computation (MPC):
Involve multiple entities computing on jointly-held secrets.

3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP):
Prove that you know or did something (like compute a model output) without revealing the inputs.

4. Circuit Obfuscation or Garbled Circuits:
Represent the logic as a garbled circuit to allow secure evaluation by third parties.
